# IL1333 Hardware Security
## Course contents
* Physical attacks and "tamper resistance".
* Side-channel attacks and countermeasures.
* Introduction to lightweight cryptography.
* Security for smart card and radio frequency identification tags (RFID-tags).
* Design for physical unclonable functions (PUFs) and true random number generators.
* Personal integrity in the Internet-of-Things era.

The course will use a programming language as the main language but also show similarities and differences with other functional languages.

## Intended learning outcomes

After passing the course, students should be able to:

* Describe state-of-the-art hardware security techniques and justify their applications and limitations.
* Describe how the safety is guaranteed in an illustrating application.
* Describe the threats against a system from hardware perspective and available countermeasures and apply the knowledge to choose an appropriate set of countermeasures for a certain threat assessment.
* Analyse and make a critical balance between the performance, cost and safety of the system and illustrate compromises that are available for design engineers of electronic and embedded systems.
* Explain the need of hardware security primitives and justify advantages and disadvantages with the different primitives and choose an appropriate primitive for a specific application.
* Use the knowledge to build a small electronic or embedded system for increased safety and explain how the safety is guaranteed in the system.
